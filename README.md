# ECommerceApi

In doing this project I use JavaScript and use MongoDB as a database. There are two folders named package and routes where the former folder contains the database schema and the latter one has the code that is used to route them accordingly. 
Postman is used to create, update, and delete the items in the collections and this project has an authentication portion to verify the user so make the API a secure one.
Postman is used since it simplifies API deployment and increases the efficiency and proficiency of the API deployment.
